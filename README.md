# Introduction

The information contained here serves as a getting started guide for
those who are interested in following a plan similar to mine for
managing insulin resistance as it pertains to health and nutrition.
My plan is guided by the following pillars:

1. Healthier: Higher quality and healthier foods
2. Keto: Lower carb consumption
3. Intermittent Fasting: Reduced eating windows
4. Exercise
5. Sleep



## Healthier

Eliminate the no brainers - foods containing:
- added sugar
- unhealthy ingredients (bad oils, corn syrup in all it's variations,
  et al)
- fatty oils that use heat and/or chemical extraction (vegetable,
  soybean, and corn oils), or any food containing these oils as an
  ingredient
- tans fats
- added nitrites or nitrates
- processed foods

Enhance the quality:
- Non-GMO
- Organic
- Gluten free

Oils:
- Switched our cooking oil to either Avocado Oil or Coconut Oil and use Extra Virgin Olive Oil for salads ([Best and Worst Oils at the Grocery Store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJxT0V6ma2U))

Meats:
- Source the majority of our meats from [butcherbox.com](https://www.butcherbox.com) or purchase S4 certified meats from Whole Foods.
- Pasture raised eggs ([cornucopia.org](https://www.cornucopia.org)) ([Everything You Need To Know About Eggs - Cage Free, Free Range, Pasture Raised, and More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTdh-KoI-tQ))
- Wild raised fish/seafood only ([Farm Raised Fish OR Wild Caught Fish, Which Is Best To Consume? - Dr.Berg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2uAyp6WCnA))
- Grass fed/finished beef ([Grass Grass-Fed vs Grass Finished Beef: Big Difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70SUKkUaMo4))
- Free range organic chicken



## Keto

- [How to Start Keto Correctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR6TnC1RY_8)

My criteria:
- No grains (eg bread, spaghetti, ...)
- No starches
- No refined carbohydrates (eg rice, ...)
- No milk
- Dramatically decreased fruit consumption (no bananas, grapes, apples, pares, ...)

- Vegetables ([Top 15 Keto Vegetables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udj27XHJxjw)):

Some other changes related to Keto:
- Increased vegetable consumption
- Increased oil usage
- Increased egg consumption ([Why I Eat 4 to 5 Eggs a Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH8RsqjlS2o))
- Increased cheese consumption



## Intermittent Fasting

- [Top 10 Foods To Eat For Intermittent Fasting Benefits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0U1CJnbrPU)

Initially, I recommend removing all snacking between meals (simple
insulin management).

Find something to drink between meals that's calorie free in addition
to water.  Typically that's black coffee or expresso (without
milk/sugar) or green tea.  Anytime you get hungry between meals, drink
water, make yourself coffee, or green tea.

On day one, I recommend starting out by alternating eating and fasting
in 12 hour windows.  For example, eat between 8am and 8pm, three meals,
without snacks between.

When you're comfortable with that, move to an 16/8 plan.  For example,
eat between 11am and 7pm, two meals, without snacks between.

When you're comfortable with that, move to an 18/6, 20/4, and/or 22/2
plan, continuing along the same lines, eating two meals, trying to
finish by 7pm (as an example).

When you're comfortable with that, try one meal a day (OMAD),
combining all your calories into a single meal, at say 5 or 6pm each
day.

Here was my progression as an example:
- On day 1 I stopped snacking between meals.
- On day 8 I began a 16/8 plan (11am-7pm), 3 meals a day.
- On day 11 I transitioned my 16/8 plan to (11am-7pm) 2 meals a day.
- On day 16 I began a 20/4 plan (3pm-7pm), 2 meals a day.
- On day 18 I tried one meal a day (OMAD) (6-7pm), but reverted to 20/4, as I felt at the time it was too much food at one time.
- On day 34 I began using OMAD and haven't looked back.  I typically eat between 4:30 and 7pm (earlier the better).



# Getting Started

## Research

I recommend starting with [Jason
Fung's](https://www.youtube.com/user/drjasonfung) book [The Obesity
Code](https://www.amazon.com/Obesity-Code-Unlocking-Secrets-Weight/dp/1771641258/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA641_Nu-5JQ_vI1KFjdEEVUMw-2O2lNgMZ3R4IFlL_NkTpM4PFIVoihoClacQAvD_BwE&hvadid=324980276116&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9031975&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=17443063990521015644&hvtargid=kwd-624588442537&hydadcr=15557_10342300&keywords=intermittent+fasting+by+dr+jason+fung&qid=1608236200&sr=8-1-spons&tag=googhydr-20&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE4NTlES0pFRlMzSTcmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxNTMzNTAxS1o2N1VINk81MVI3JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA1Mzc5MzgyQzlXWlNTSzBPMkVWJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==).
I found that this book provided an extremely good overview of insulin
resistance.
